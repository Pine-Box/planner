## Acceptance Criteria

The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Color-code each time block based on past, present, and future when the time block is viewed.
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a time block

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that time block.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page
